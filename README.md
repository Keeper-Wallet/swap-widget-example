# Keeper Swap Widget

Keeper Swap Widget provides users of your website with a handy tool for exchanging tokens of the Waves ecosystem at the best price. The widget displays all exchange options and suggests the most profitable one in real time. Check the [Demos](#demos)!

By default, the widget uses built-in [Signer](https://docs.waves.tech/en/building-apps/waves-api-and-sdk/client-libraries/signer) to connect a user wallet: Keeper, Waves.Exchange, or Ledger. However, if Signer is already implemented on your website, you can pass the Signer object and the user address to the widget so the user don't have to log in twice.

Whatâ€™s more, you can become our partner and receive a portion of fee from each exchange made in Keeper Swap Widget embedded in your website.

  Connect the user wallet:

  ```javascript
  const signer = new window.signer.Signer();
  signer.setProvider(/* ... */);

  const widget = KeeperSwapWidget.create(/* ... */);

  widget.setWallet({
    address,
    signer,
  });
  ```

  Disconnect the user wallet:

  ```javascript
  widget.setWallet(null);
  ```

- `destroy()` is needed to remove the widget if it's no longer needed:

  ```javascript
  widget.destroy();
  ```
